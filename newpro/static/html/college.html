Aravind, with its mission to ‘eliminate needless blindness’, provides large 
volume, high quality and affordable care. 
50% of its patients receive services either free of cost or at steeply 
subsidised rate, 
yet the organisation remains financially self-sustainable. 
Much importance is given to equity – ensuring that all patients are accorded 
the 
same high quality care and service, regardless of their economic status. 
A critical component of Aravind’s model is the high patient volume, which 
brings with it the benefits of economies of scale.
